# netflix_recommendation
This project aims to build a Netflix Movie Recommendation System using machine learning and data analysis techniques. By analyzing a dataset of Netflix shows and movies, the system provides personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences. 

Key Features:
* Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values, corrected data types, and prepped the dataset for analysis.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted thorough analysis to identify trends in popular genres, release years, ratings, and audience preferences.
* Recommendation Algorithm: Built a recommendation system using collaborative filtering, recommending movies based on similarities between user preferences and viewing history.
* Evaluation: Implemented metrics such as Precision@K and Recall@K to evaluate the accuracy of the recommendation model.

Tools & Libraries:
* Python: Used for data manipulation and modeling.
* Pandas and NumPy: For data handling and preprocessing.
* Seaborn and Matplotlib: For visualizing trends and relationships in the dataset.
* SciKit-Learn: For building machine learning models.
